# WarServer-Redesign
This project is a redesign of a website for a client who runs a handful of Quake 3 Arean servers for public use. His previouse website was straight to the point and got the job done but he wanted something that was faster and had a bit more style to it as well as something that was responisve to mobile.

I have kept the same text "content", but implemented it in different ways to give it more flair but still hold true to what he was trying to originally portray. The project will be responsive for bot mobile and tablet sizes as well.

Built with ReactJS.
